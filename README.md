# PyCUBs is an integrated package for codon usage bias analysis

## Introduction

It provides not only the calculation of several popular codon bias indices, but also several conventional codon usage bias analysis methods, such as neutrality plot analysis, ENC-GC3s plot analysis, parity rule 2-bias plot analysis, optimal codon analysis, correspondence analysis, principal component analysis, and phylogenetic analysis. It provides an interactive analysis method for freely exploring codon bias and visualizing these results.

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/thecgs/pyCUBs.git
```

**Note:** Python >=3.8 is required.
